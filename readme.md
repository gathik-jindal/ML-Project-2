# ML-Project-2

To get started it is recommended to create a virtual environment. You can do this using the following command:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

To activate the virtual environment, use the following command:

- On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

- On macOS and Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Dependencies

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Work division

Person A:

- Tree-Based and Ensemble Methods
- Decision Trees (baseline)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)
- Apply to both datasets​

Person B:

- Probabilistic and Distance-Based Methods
- Naive Bayes (Bayes classifier)​ (optional)
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Logistic Regression (for both binary and multi-class)​
- Apply to both datasets

Person C:

- Advanced Methods (in the end if time permits)
- Support Vector Machines (with different kernels)​
- Gaussian Mixture Models (for clustering comparison)
- Simple Neural Network (optional)​
- Unsupervised clustering analysis (K-means, hierarchical)​
- Apply to both datasets
